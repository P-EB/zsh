zsh
===

This repository is my personnal zsh config files repo.
This work is essentially based on other dev's work, found
on grml website : http://git.grml.org

I do not recommend to use these files, and I can't guarantee
their usage will be safe, but you may find interesting
stuff in them.

All of this work is published under GPLv3 license, except
if not compatible with grml's files license.
